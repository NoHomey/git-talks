Plan for describing what git and github are and how to use them

1. Introduction
2. Story of git
3. What is "version control", and why should you care?

> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time
> so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples we will use software source code as the files being
> version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
